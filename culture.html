                        From ancient to current times, bananas have been found in multiple forms of media including: gastronomy, literature, film and even clothing. The banana&#39;s influence on culture is far-reaching and easily noticeable. First and foremost, bananas have ingrained themselves into the cultures of many civilizations as food. For some cultures such as the Filipinos, the fruit of the banana plant is a staple food that is found in many traditional dishes such as maruya or halo-halo. In other Asian cultures, banana hearts are used in stews. In cultures such as those found in the United States of America, the fruit of the banana is most often simply eaten as a healthy snack.

                        Bananas have also emerged into the culture of textiles. As early as the thirteenth century, fibers obtained from the banana plant have been used in Japan for clothing. Different cultures use different portions of the banana plant to obtain fibers for textile work. For instance, the Japanese use offshoots of the banana plant, and the people Nepal often gather the fibers from the trunk of the plant. Most anything can be made out of the fibers of a banana plant including kimonos, rugs and tablecloths. Beyond textiles, bananas are also known to be used to make paper. Either the bark or the stem&#39;s fibers are used for making the paper.

                        Bananas have been seen in the arts for hundreds of years. One of the most recognizable components of slapstick comedy is that of a person slipping on a banana peel. Most American cartoons such as Spongebob Squarepants would be amiss without a few gags involving one of the character&#39;s unknowingly slipping on a banana peel. Andy Warhol, a well known American artist, probably painted one of the most well known bananas in 1966 as the album artwork for The Velvet Underground & Nico&#39;s debut album. Bananas can also be found in music. In 1923, Frank Silver and Irving Cohn wrote and released a song called <q>Yes! We Have No Bananas</q> which is a song that is closely attributed to banana shortages. Another prominent song involving bananas was the song <q>Bananaphone</q> written by Raffi Cavoukian a Canadian singer-songwriter and child entertainer.

                        In recent years, bananas have worked their way into many forms of popular culture. For instance, they have made a big hit in the film industry under the Despicable Me movies. As of this point, there have been two Despicable Me movies with a third in the works currently, each of these movies have contained a large group of lovable, yellow creatures called &#39;Minions.&#39; These &#39;Minions&#39; are well known for their love of bananas, and they even have a scene where they sing a song about bananas in a teaser trailer for the second installment of the Despicable Me series. Even well known shows such as Arrested Development have nods to the banana as several scenes throughout the show involve the family&#39;s beloved frozen banana stand. It has also become a trend to use bananas as a scale of measurement in pictures to help the viewer better visualize the actual size of the object of focus within the image.
