                        Bananas have had an incredible evolution and movement since their origination in Papua New Guinea. From their origins, the banana plant spread to the Philippines and then to the tropics. From the tropics, the plant spread across the world and made an impact as one of the most known and enjoyed fruit. The current world rank holds the top three producers of bananas in order as India, China and the Philippines. The demand for the fruit of the banana plant has gone up dramatically in the past half century. In fact, production has risen by 93 million metric tons in that time. With the demand being so high, and continuously rising, bananas have become a very important factor not only in these countries’ economies but also in their cultures.

                        The production chain for bananas is relatively simple. As an example, the following is a representation of the production of bananas in a tropical region of the world such as the Caribbean; however, the example can also be stretched to fit the description of production in other regions of the world. From the start, the banana plant is planted in the ground and given the proper nutrients and protection necessary to grow healthily. After several months (typically nine to eleven), the fruit and other parts of the plant are ready to be harvested. Workers cut the fruit from the plant and deconstruct the the rest of the plant in order to prepare it for another growth cycle. The fruit of the plant is taken to a processing plant where everything from cleaning to sorting to packaging the fruit occurs. In the case of the Caribbean islands, the processed fruit is shipped by seafaring vessel to countries such as the United States where the product goes through a wholesale process. At the end of the chain, retailers sell the fruit to the consumers who then enjoy the fruit.

                        Much like any agricultural product, the banana is subject to many natural disasters. One of the bigger concerns, according to the 2013 Ministry of Food and Agriculture Article, is the destruction of the plant by natural forces. During the several months it takes the banana plant to mature, it is vulnerable to many dangers. One of the more common things that can ruin the banana plant is wind. In order to protect the plant, windbreakers must be built around the fields. Another unavoidable but widespread threat to production is the plant pathogen Fusarium Oxysporum which causes the plant’s tunnel to become infected and rots the root or causes blackhead disease. Special measures such as spraying the crops with chemicals occur during the production cycle in order to help protect the plants from these diseases.
