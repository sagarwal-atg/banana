                        Bananas and the plants they grow on are highly popular. It is not a surprise with their many uses ranging anywhere from cooking to paper making that bananas are a strongly sought after commodity. Banana plants are best known to be grown in the so called “Banana Belt,” a region of the world contained within the tropics. Although bananas are grown in many countries, those countries found within the banana belt are responsible for most of the growth. In 2015 alone, banana exports by countries totaled eleven billion USD. Among these countries, those found in Latin America and the Caribbean had the highest dollar value worth of banana exports with up to $6.3 billion USD in exports which equates to 59.3% of the global banana market. Europe was next following with around 22.1% of the total banana market with Africa trailing behind at 6.8% of the market.

                        Looking at imports, the European Union, United States and  Russian Federation are the three largest banana purchasing countries (regions) of the world. In 2014, the United States alone imported over four billion USD in bananas which is equivalent to four million metric tons of bananas. The United States covered over 26% of the world’s banana imports. Although the import price for bananas in the United States lowered from 2012 to 2013, the price has stayed around 800 USD per tonne of bananas. Regardless of the decrease in import price for bananas, the retail price has stayed relatively flat in recent years for consumers due to the high demand for fresh fruit. The price per pound has changed little over the past two decades, and as of 2016, the price was around 0.58 USD per pound. Of course, in different parts of the world, the prices of bananas vary. For instance, in Ethiopia, five USD can purchase around 25 pounds of bananas. This is partly due to the fact that Ethiopia produces many of its own bananas. In 2014 alone, Ethiopia had a total banana production value of 478,251 tonnes.

                        The three largest banana traders in the world according to the Food and Agriculture Organization are Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte. The combined market of these three corporations was at the highest during the 1980’s when they controlled almost two-thirds of the world banana exports. Since the 1980’s, the shares have declined, and in 2013, the total market share of the top five companies was around 44.4% with these companies being: Chiquita (13%), Fresh del Monte (12%), Dole (11%), Fyffes (6%) and Noboa (2%). The other 55.6% of the total market share is controlled by numerous other small companies. The major banana traders have a strong hold on the production of bananas; therefore, they also have a massive influence on their value. The biggest companies run their own plantations, own their own forms of transport and facilitate distribution networks in the countries that consume their product. Regardless, at least in recent years, some of the power has seen itself move over to hands of the retailers as they are the final say in the price of the bananas.
