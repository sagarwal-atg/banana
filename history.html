                        Kuk Valley of Papua New Guinea around 8000 BCE is considered to be the area where humans first domesticated bananas with known instance by archeologists. From New Guinea to the Philippines, bananas spread throughout the world. Plantains (a less sweet form of bananas) are believed to have begun growing in Eastern Africa as early as 3000 BCE. Over time, the banana plant was introduced all over the world forming it into the highly regarded fruit that it is today.

                        In the early days of plantations, bananas were valuable not only for their fruit but for their leaves as well. Bananas were a useful intercropping plant. Their large leaves helped provide shade to other plants such as coffee, pepper, or cacao which tend to rely on indirect and variable sunlight. The fruit of the banana plant was also important in feeding the slave laborers of those plantations. As it is packed with many vital calories and nutrients, it easily became a popular food for slaves. In some cases, the leaves of the banana plant served a second purpose. Due to their large shape and water resistance, they could often be used to make roofs for shelters.

                        Interestingly enough, the United Fruit company had a strong hold on the government in Guatemala during the 1900’s. When their control was threatened by a freely elected government, the company worked with the CIA to install a dictator within the country allowing the United Fruit Company to keep control over Guatemala’s government, a task necessary in order to have the ability to grow banana plants cheaply. The first banana epidemic caused by a banana targeting disease occurred sometime in the 1920’s when a certain type of mold attacked large populations of the Gros Michel banana. The disease led to the creation of the Cavendish banana which was resistant to that particular strain of mold.
