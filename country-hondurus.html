                        Honduras has a rich history in the production of bananas, and the country has been a large producer since the late 1800s (with a major increase in exportation of bananas after several U.S. banana companies invested into local infrastructure). Although banana production initially seemed good for the country, it eventually brought many problems to Honduras.

                    <p>
                        By the early 1900s, the countryâ€™s banana production was strongly influenced by interference from the U.S. as many American based companies were deeply invested in the country. The companies would receive tax cuts on agricultural lands from the Honduran government in return for bribes giving these companies strong control over the production of bananas. At one point, the United Fruit Company controlled the vast majority of banana production land in Honduras. Of course, all of this interference eventually led to massive issues with the Honduran economy and political system in the 80s and 90s.

                        Honduras has also suffered from a major banana disease epidemic caused by Panama Disease which killed off much of the Gros Michel banana populations. there is a noticeable point in the Honduran banana production timeline where most farmers moved from the Gros Michel banana to the Cavendish banana as Panama Disease began to wreak havoc on that particular strain
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the issues that Honduras dealt with several decades ago still plague the country to this day proving how important the banana is to the people and country of Honduras. Of course, the banana is not all bad. In some ways, it has saved the country as it is one of their major cash crops and it has created and supplied jobs and economic stimulus to a small island nation.
