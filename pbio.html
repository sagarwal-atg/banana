                        Bananas belong to one of 50 species within the Musaceae family. Cultivated bananas have 33 chromosomes whereas wild bananas have 22 which displays the great lengths taken by humans in order to modify the mass produced bananas that we all know today into the form that they currently hold. One of the major differences between wild bananas and domesticated bananas are the seeds. In wild bananas, the seeds are hard and prevalent throughout the fruit. Domesticated bananas, however, have a fruit that is seedless allowing it to be enjoyed easily. The banana &#39;tree&#39; is actually a plant that grows to a large height. The plant grows fruit in clusters known as &#39;hands,&#39; and large groups of &#39;hands&#39; form groupings called &#39;bunches.&#39; The skins of the fruit, otherwise known as the epidermis, come in various colors including yellow, red, or brown and are in fact edible.

                        Banana plants are nonseasonal (a major reason for which they are available year round all over the world), and they are grown from bulbs or rhizomes rather than seeds. The pseudostem of the banana plant, the thick stalk that can grow to large heights, lives long enough for harvest and then dies. The rhizome has the ability to grow a new pseudostem several times after each banana harvest restarting the cycle until the rhizome dies. Within nine to twelve months of planting a banana plant, the fruit is ready to be harvested. Bananas mature 60 to 90 days after the flower of the plant appears. Generally, the fruit is the most widely sold part of the banana; however, the banana plant&#39;s sap, bark, leaves and much more are known to have their own uses. Often, the leaves and stalks of the old banana plant are left on the ground in order to provide vital nutrients to the next set of plants.

                        One major problem with the biology of bananas is their lack of genetic diversity. Specific species of banana plants are all basically clones of each other on the genetic level. This of course is problematic as a singular disease such as Fusarium Wilt or Fusarium Oxysporum can wipe out entire populations of bananas with ease. Since all the bananas are genetically similar, if one plant lacks the ability to defend itself from a disease, the rest of the banana plants also lack the ability to defend themselves from the disease. Banana plants are also susceptible to pests. For instance, one bug known as the banana root borer or scientifically, the Cosmopolites sordidus has caused a lot of trouble for the banana growing regions of the world. The bug is a form of weevil which kills banana plants by laying its eggs inside the leaf sheaths and stems of the plant.
