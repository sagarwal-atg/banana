              There a several issues surrounding the production of bananas. These issues range anywhere from tropical disease threatening to kill off the worldâ€™s most consumed strain of banana to the environmental effects massive deforestation has caused in order to create more banana farms. All told, there are four major types of issues. These issues include the environmental, ethical, social, and economic problems created by bananas and their production.
          </p>
        <h2>Environmental</h2>
        <p>
            The most produced and marketed banana is the Cavendish banana. It is grown in massive quantities in the tropical regions of the world and is sold in massive quantities to countries like the United States of America. Unfortunately, there is a strain of Fusarium Wilt (otherwise known as Tropical Race Four) that is spreading across the banana belt leading to the death of many Cavendish banana plants. This disease could lead to the mass extinction of the entire strain of Cavendish bananas which would wipe bananas as we know them off the food map. The loss of a major strain of bananas due to a tropical disease has already been seen in the Gros Michel banana which was practically wiped out by the Fusarium Oxysporum strain.
        </p>
        <h2>Ethical</h2>
        <p>
            The need to produce more bananas during the 1980s and 1990s in order to supply to a market with increasing demand led to the destruction of much rainforest land in order for it to be used for banana plantations. While this may be seen as more of an environmental issue, it is also ethical in nature as it creates the question of whether we destroy rainforests for food or keep rainforests intact. Obviously, in this situation the answer to that question was to destroy the rainforest in order to plant more banana plants.
        </p>

        <h2>Social</h2>
        <p>
            As stated, there was a massive boom in the banana industry around the 1980s and 1990s which lead to many issues in and of itself; however, after this boom, there was a decline in the banana market. This drop in the market forced many major banana companies to ramp down production which inevitably lead to the loss of many jobs by people in tropic nations who were working on banana plantations. In the end, the downfall of the market brought some families to extreme poverty.
        </p>

        <h2>Economic</h2>
        <p>
            Bananas themselves cause a lot of problems for the economies of some of these small island nations. The banana is a massive cash crop for a lot of the smaller island nations in the tropics. If when the banana market increases, these nations are in a good place, but when the market falls, the nations and their people often suffer as drops in the market can lead to major drops in exportation which can lead to the fall of banana plantations and the loss of jobs.
